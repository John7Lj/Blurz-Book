## Core Concepts

### What is the Internet?

**"Nuts and Bolts" View:**
- Billions of connected computing devices (hosts/end systems)
- Packet switches (routers, switches) forward packets
- Communication links (fiber, copper, radio, satellite) with transmission rates (bandwidth)
- Networks: collection of devices, routers, links managed by an organization
- Network of networks: interconnected ISPs
- Protocols control sending/receiving (TCP, IP, HTTP, WiFi, 4G/5G, Ethernet)
- Standards: IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), RFC (Request for Comments)

**"Services" View:**
- Infrastructure providing services to applications (Web, streaming, email, games, IoT)
- Programming interface for distributed applications ("hooks" to connect to Internet transport)

### Protocols
Rules defining format, order of messages sent/received and actions taken. All Internet communication governed by protocols.

## Network Edge

### Components
- **Hosts**: clients and servers (often in data centers)
- **Access networks**: connect end systems to edge router
- **Physical media**: wired/wireless communication links

### Access Network Types

**Cable-Based (HFC - Hybrid Fiber Coax):**
- FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing)
- Asymmetric: 40 Mbps-1.2 Gbps downstream, 30-100 Mbps upstream
- Shared network to cable headend

**DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):**
- Uses existing telephone lines
- 24-52 Mbps downstream, 3.5-16 Mbps upstream (dedicated)

**Wireless:**
- **WLAN (WiFi)**: 11-450 Mbps, ~100 ft range, 802.11b/g/n
- **Wide-area cellular**: 4G/5G, 10+ Mbps, ~10 km range

**Enterprise Networks:**
- Mix of Ethernet (100 Mbps-10 Gbps) and WiFi
- Connects switches and routers

**Data Centers:**
- High-bandwidth links (10s-100s Gbps)
- Connect hundreds/thousands of servers

### Physical Media

**Guided Media:**
- **Twisted Pair (TP)**: Cat 5 (100 Mbps-1 Gbps), Cat 6 (10 Gbps)
- **Coaxial Cable**: Bidirectional, 100s Mbps per channel
- **Fiber Optic**: Light pulses, 10s-100s Gbps, low error rate, immune to noise

**Unguided Media (Wireless):**
- WiFi, 4G/5G, Bluetooth, microwave, satellite

## Network Core

### Key Functions

**Forwarding (Switching):**
- Local action: move packets from input to output link
- Uses forwarding table

**Routing:**
- Global action: determine source-destination paths
- Uses routing algorithms

### Packet Switching
- Hosts break messages into packets (length L bits)
- Transmission delay = L/R (R = link transmission rate)
- **Store-and-forward**: entire packet must arrive before forwarding
- **Queueing**: packets wait when arrival rate exceeds transmission rate
- **Packet loss**: occurs when buffer fills up

### Circuit Switching
- End-end resources allocated and reserved for "call"
- Dedicated resources (no sharing), guaranteed performance
- Idle if not used
- **FDM**: Frequency Division Multiplexing
- **TDM**: Time Division Multiplexing

**Comparison:**
- Packet switching: better for bursty data, resource sharing, simpler
- Circuit switching: guaranteed performance, predictable quality
- Packet switching can experience congestion, delay, and loss

### Internet Structure
Hierarchical "network of networks":
- **Access ISPs** at the edges
- **Regional ISPs** connect access nets
- **Tier-1 ISPs**: national/international coverage (Level 3, Sprint, AT&T)
- **Content Provider Networks**: private networks (Google, Facebook)
- **IXPs (Internet Exchange Points)**: connect different ISPs
- **Peering links**: direct connections between ISPs

## Performance

### Delay Components
**d_nodal = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop**

1. **Processing delay (d_proc)**: Check errors, determine output link (<microsecs)
2. **Queueing delay (d_queue)**: Waiting at output link (depends on congestion)
3. **Transmission delay (d_trans)**: L/R (L=packet length, R=transmission rate)
4. **Propagation delay (d_prop)**: d/s (d=link length, s=propagation speed ~2×10⁸ m/sec)

### Traffic Intensity
**La/R** where:
- L = packet length
- a = average arrival rate
- R = link bandwidth

- La/R ~ 0: small queueing delay
- La/R → 1: large queueing delay
- La/R > 1: infinite delay (unstable)

### Throughput
Rate at which bits transfer from sender to receiver:
- **Bottleneck link**: link that constrains end-end throughput
- End-end throughput = min(Rc, Rs, R/10 for shared links)

### Packet Loss
Occurs when queue buffer fills up; lost packets may be retransmitted

## Security Threats

1. **Packet Sniffing**: Reading packets on broadcast media
2. **IP Spoofing**: Sending packets with false source address
3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overwhelming resources with bogus traffic

**Defenses:**
- Authentication, encryption, integrity checks
- Access restrictions, firewalls
- Password-protected VPNs

## Protocol Layers

### Internet Protocol Stack (5 layers)
1. **Application**: Supporting network apps (HTTP, SMTP, DNS)
2. **Transport**: Process-process transfer (TCP, UDP)
3. **Network**: Routing datagrams (IP, routing protocols)
4. **Link**: Data transfer between neighbors (Ethernet, WiFi)
5. **Physical**: Bits on the wire

### Encapsulation
Each layer adds its header:
- Application: Message (M)
- Transport: Segment [Ht | M]
- Network: Datagram [Hn | Ht | M]
- Link: Frame [Hl | Hn | Ht | M]

### Layering Benefits
- Explicit structure for system organization
- Modularization eases maintenance
- Changes in one layer transparent to others

### OSI Model (7 layers)
Adds **Presentation** (encryption, compression) and **Session** (synchronization) layers

## Internet History Timeline

**1961-1972**: Early packet-switching (Kleinrock, Baran), ARPAnet, NCP, first email

**1972-1980**: Internetworking principles (Cerf & Kahn), Ethernet, ALOHAnet

**1980-1990**: TCP/IP deployment, DNS, SMTP, FTP, TCP congestion control

**1990-2000s**: Web (Berners-Lee), HTTP/HTML, Mosaic/Netscape, P2P, IM

**2005-present**: Broadband, SDN, 4G/5G, cloud computing, smartphones, ~15B devices

## Key Principles

**Cerf and Kahn's Internetworking:**
- Minimalism, autonomy
- Best-effort service model
- Stateless routing
- Decentralized control
